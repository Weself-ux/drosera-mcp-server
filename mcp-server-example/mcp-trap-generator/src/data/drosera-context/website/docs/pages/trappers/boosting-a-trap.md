# Boosting a Trap ðŸš€

Drosera allows anyone to increase the priority of a Trap's response action by leveraging the Bloom Boost mechanism. By depositing ETH, a Trap's response action will have boosted priority to be included on-chain as soon as possible. This allows for lightning-fast incident response times to be achieved.

To boost a trap, simply run:

```bash
drosera bloomboost --trap-address <address> --eth-amount <amount>
```
