# Operator Rewards ðŸ¦¾

Incentivizing operators to monitor protocols.

## Overview

Operators in Drosera not only contribute to the security and stability of the DeFi ecosystem, but they also have the opportunity to earn passive rewards for continuously participating in the network.

In addition to the passive rewards, Operators can also earn a bonus reward when their submission for a detected exploit is accepted by the Drosera Trap Manager. This incentivizes Operators to be proactive in identifying potential threats and exploits, further enhancing the security of the network.

Drosera's reward system ensures that Operators are properly incentivized to maintain the highest levels of security and performance, fostering a collaborative and secure DeFi ecosystem.
