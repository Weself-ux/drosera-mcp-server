# Dormant Contract Reactivation Trap

A Drosera trap that monitors dormant or abandoned smart contracts (especially from rug-pulled or failed projects) for dormancy detection and reactivation alerts, sending real-time alerts via Telegram.

## Overview

This trap monitors a specified contract address and triggers alerts when the contracts become reactivate after a period of inactivity. Useful for detecting potential exploitation attempts where bad actors reactivate previously dormant contracts, often seen in:

- Rug pull attempts using old contract infrastructure
- Exploitation of abandoned DeFi protocols
- Reactivation of failed project contracts for malicious purposes
- legitimate contract reactivations

## How It Works

The trap uses a two window approach to reliably detect contract reactivation.

## Detection Logic

Older Window (20 blocks): Must show complete stability (no balance or codehash changes)

Newer Window (5 blocks): Must show activity (balance or codehash changes)

## Logic:

- Monitors contract across 30+ block history
- Verifies older window (blocks 5-25) remained dormant with no state changes
- Checks newer window (blocks 0-4) for activity
- Only triggers "REACTIVATED" alert when both conditions are met:

Older window was stable (proving dormancy)

Newer window shows changes (proving reactivation)

This approach eliminates false positives by requiring proof of both dormancy and reactivation, rather than just detecting current activity.

## Component

## DormantContractTrap.sol
The main trap contract that implements the dormancy detection logic..

## DormantResponseContract.sol
Receives alerts from Drosera and emits events for external monitoring.

## monitor.js
Node.js script that listens for dormancy events and sends Telegram notifications.

## Setup Instructions

1. Deploy the DormantResponseContract.sol on hoodi chain

2. Create trap configuration file:

bash 

nano drosera.toml

## Add your trap configuration:

nano drosera.toml
[trap.dormant_trap]

file = "nano src/DormantContractTrap.sol"

contract = "DormantContractTrap"

file = "nano src/DormantResponseContract.sol"

contract = "DormantResponseContract"

function = "notifyDormancyChange"

## Deploy with Drosera CLI

bash

forge build

DROSERA_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key drosera apply

### 2. Configure Telegram Bot

1. Create a Telegram bot via [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)
2. Get your bot token
3. Get your chat ID by messaging [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot)

### 3. Setup Node.js Monitor

1. Install dependencies:
   bash
   npm install node-telegram-bot-api web3
 

2. Update configuration in monitor.js:
   ```javascript
   const config = {
       telegramToken: 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN',
       contractAddress: 'YOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS',
       rpcUrl: 'wss://your-rpc-endpoint',
       chatId: 'YOUR_CHAT_ID'
   };
   ```

3. Run the monitor:
   bash
   node monitor.js
   

## Testing the Trap

Once deployed, test your dormant contract monitor:

Check Drosera Dashboard: Verify your trap is active and collecting data (Green Blocks)

Monitor Logs: Watch the monitor.js console output for activity detection using command prompt

Wait for Natural Dormancy: The trap will trigger when the monitored contract has no activity for 25+ blocks

Verify Alerts: Check your Telegram for dormancy notifications when the trap triggers

Test Response Contract: Ensure the response contract receives and processes alerts correctly

The trap automatically monitors the specified contract and will alert when dormancy conditions are met.

## Key Features

- **Real-time monitoring** of contract activity changes
- **Configurable dormancy periods** for different use cases  
- **Telegram integration** for instant notifications
- **Transaction tracking** with block and hash details
- **Health monitoring** with periodic status updates

## Alert Example

When a dormant contract reactivates, you'll receive:

```
üö® DROSERA ALERT üö®

üîç Dormant Contract Activated!
üìß Contract: 0x1234...abcd
‚è∞ Activation Time: 1/15/2025, 3:45:22 PM
üîó Block: 942828
üìã Transaction: 0x5678...efgh

‚ö†Ô∏è This contract was previously dormant and has suddenly become active.

üîç Investigate immediately!
```

## Use Cases

- **Security Monitoring**: Watch abandoned DeFi protocols for unexpected reactivation
- **Rug Pull Detection**: Monitor failed projects that might attempt to reactivate for malicious purposes
- **Research**: Track contract lifecycle patterns and reactivation behaviors
- **Portfolio Protection**: Monitor investments in projects that have gone dormant

## Network Compatibility

- Ethereum Mainnet
- Holesky Testnet  
- Hoodi Chain
- Any EVM-compatible network

## Future Enhancements

- Automatic contract discovery based on activity patterns
- Integration with multiple notification channels eg. (Discord)
- Advanced pattern recognition for suspicious reactivation behaviors
- Multi-chain monitoring support
- Integration with other Drosera traps for comprehensive security coverage
